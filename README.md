# POS10C

Custom Point of Sale system for [10 CAMP](https://10camp.com), built to replace EasyStore POS with a leaner, in-house alternative tailored to the shop's workflow.

## Live

- App: <https://pos.10camp.com> (alias of <https://pos-system-test.netlify.app>)
- Demo login: PIN `8888` (Tester account, External Demo mode — safe for walkthroughs)

## What it does

A web-based POS that runs in any modern browser and installs as a PWA on tablets and phones. It handles the full retail loop end-to-end:

- **Cashier** — cart, split payment, walk-in quick checkout, customer-facing display, receipt print
- **Inventory** — products, variants, batches, stock-take, low-stock alerts, purchase orders
- **Customers** — registry with phone-deduped profiles, B2B accounts, loyalty points
- **Finance** — daily sales, refunds, expenses, P&L, cash drawer reconciliation
- **HR / Roster** — staff list, shift schedule, attendance
- **Marketing** — campaigns, promo codes, bundle pricing
- **Intelligence** — sales dashboards, anomaly alerts, "Tanya 10 CAMP" AI assistant (Claude-powered)
- **Channel sync** — two-way EasyStore integration (POS sale pushes to EasyStore; online orders webhook back into POS and deduct stock)

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Vanilla HTML / CSS / JavaScript (no framework) |
| Styling | Custom design tokens, namespaced per feature |
| Backend | Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage) |
| Serverless | Netlify Functions (Node) |
| AI | Anthropic Claude API (via `claude-ask` function) |
| Hosting | Netlify (auto-deploy on push to `main`) |
| PWA | Manifest + service worker for offline-capable install |

## Mode system

The app exposes four roles, each with its own landing page and visible sidebar groups:

- **Cashier** — cart + checkout only
- **Operasi** — cashier + inventory + roster
- **Pengurus** — operasi + finance + reports + customer / B2B
- **Investor** — read-only finance dashboards

Per-staff overrides are stored in `localStorage` under `staffModeAccess_v1`. Login is PIN-only with auto-detection via `__detectUserByPin`.

## Local setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brozaidtodak/Pos-System-Test.git
cd Pos-System-Test
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project>.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon-key>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<service-role>   # for sync scripts only
EASYSTORE_TOKEN=<easystore-api-token>      # for channel sync
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<claude-key>             # for Tanya 10 CAMP
```

Run with Netlify CLI so the serverless functions resolve:

```bash
netlify dev
```

Open <http://localhost:8888>.
